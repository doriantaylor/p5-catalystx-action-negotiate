CatalystX::Action::Negotiate - ActionRole for content negotiation

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

our $VERSION = '0.01';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    sub default :Path :Does('+CatalystX::Action::Negotiate') {
        my ($self, $c) = @_;

        # obtain variants (if you care)
        my @variants = @{$c->stash->{variants}};

        # maybe manipulate them? i dunno

        # set them back, or set entirely new ones
        $c->stash->{variants} = \@variants;

        # action class negotiates variants and returns the winner
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module serves content-negotiated static content from the document
root. It also affords mixing dynamic variants in with static variants,
the list of which is passed directly into the
L<HTTP::Negotiate/choose> function. The winning variant is chosen from
the various C<Accept-*> request headers.

As with Apache and other Web servers, dimensions for static variants
are derived from file extensions. Currently the only supported
dimension is MIME content type.

There is a slight difference in the behaviour between this module and
Apache: whereas there is one or more files of the form C<foo.*>
alongside a directory called C<foo> containing one or more files with
the slug C<index>, these will all be lumped into the set of variants.
The customary trailing slash, however, will only be applied in the
case that a C<foo/index.*> file is chosen over a C<foo.*> file. This
is different from Apache in that the latter ignores C<foo.*> files if
there is also a directory present called C<foo>. The purpose of this
change is to provide an easy way to style URIs I<without> the trailing
slash while still providing for descendants along the same URI path.

Interacting with the action in a handler goes as follows:

=over 4

=item 1.

The action runs and first attempts to collect any eligible static
variants found by concatenating the request-URI to the document root.
It puts what it finds in C<< $c->stash->{variants} >>. To indicate the
indeterminate state of the response to the caller, the status is
initially set to 404.

=item 2.

The action runs the calling handler, offering it an opportunity to
manipulate the variant list or intercede in the response.

=item 3.

If the handler has not changed the response code to a value below 400,
the action proceeds to select a variant and set the appropriate headers.

=item 4.

The action performs a trailing-slash check to match the request-URI to
the internal representation, redirecting if necessary with a code 301.

=item 5.

An C<If-Modified-Since> check is performed, which will return 304 if
the client already has the latest version of the document.

=item 6.

If the action has not terminated the response by now, it sets the
response body to the variant and the status to 200.

The calling controller action is sandwiched between the
variant-generating operation and the variant-selecting operation. It
is placed as an C<ARRAY> reference for your convenience in
C<< $c->stash->{variants} >>. This structure is exactly the same as
that which is passed into L<HTTP::Negotiate>, save for these
exceptions:

=over 4

=item 1.

Variants do not need to be a string identifier, but in fact can be
anything that can be consumed by a view or middleware component, e.g.,
a file handle or any other kind of supported object.

=item 2.

L<Path::Class::File> objects get special treatment, as they are what
the initial static variant list is made out of.

=item 3.

Append an additional integer to the end of a variant's record to
supply an artificial C<Last-Modified> value as a UNIX time stamp.

=back

Otherwise, consult L<HTTP::Negotiate> for how to construct the
records. This modification enables you to mix static variants in with
dynamic ones, or overwrite the list with purely dynamic variants.

    # if the path terminates with a slash, what does it mean?

    # * the path is a legitimate directory /foo/ which should be
    # forwarded internally to /foo/index

    # * the client (probably robot) is appending a trailing slash to
    # /foo which ordinarily wouldn't have one.

    # ok, so how do we want it to behave?

    # if @ps is length 0, then we are looking at the root URI, so
    # append 'index' and start looking for variants.

    # if @ps is any longer than 0, then we are looking at something
    # beneath the root.

    # if there is a trailing slash in the request, we want to do an
    # exact match on the dir(/index) first, then exact match for
    # files, then fuzzy match on the files. if no trailing slash, then
    # exact match on files first, then fuzzy match on files, then
    # dir(/index). this is different from mod_negotiate.

    # if there is a trailing slash on the request and what was found
    # was a file, 301 to a url with no trailing slash. similarly, if
